## About the Book
Vue.js is one of the latest new frameworks to have piqued the interest of web developers due to its reactivity, reusable components, and ease of use. When you combine Bootstrap with Vue.js, it provides quicker ways to create responsive web applications.

This book will teach you to add dynamic functionality to your web applications by combining Bootstrap with Vue.js. In this book, we will combine Bootstrap with Vue.js to form a complete front-end stack and build highly reactive and responsive applications. We begin by creating a simple webpage combining Vue.js, Bootstrap, and Firebase. We then go through the basic components of Bootstrap and learn how to integrate these with Vue.js to create a visually interactive Pomodoro app. While developing the app, you will go through the new grid system of Bootstrap 4 along with the much simpler directives in Vue.js. We also take advantage of the inbuilt utilities that come with Vue.js, such as the Webpack module, to better structure our application. Finally, we quickly deploy our application using Firebase, which provides Backend as a Service, to create our fully functional responsive web application.
